# URL Shortener app ✂️

## ▶️ Getting Started 

In order to start the server you need to have an environment, namely a Postgres DB. It is
configured in the contained `docker-compose.yml` file.

To start the environment run:

`docker-compose up`

and then start the server:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

### ⁉️ Why Url shortener application?
The idea was creating shorter urls to be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters  in a message. Other uses of URL shortening are to "beautify" a link, track clicks, or disguise the underlying address. 

### ❔ ❓ How it works?
It is very simple! All you need to click on this Url, and submit your original version of url that you want to be shortened. Our engins do the magic and you will have a unique shortened url as a result.
